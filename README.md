## Project Description

    1. My project is an app that will help people with damaged clothing or footwear access tailors and cobblers without leaving their home.    The app aggregates all cobblers and tailors within their vicinity, connects them with a tailor, allows them to describe the repairs     to the tailor/cobbler, and sets a drop-off and pickup time/date.

## Problem Statement

    1. Second to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world.                           (https://edgexpo.com/fashion-industry-waste-statistics/) Waste from the fashion industry is created by the way it operates to sell and  promote new trends for consumers to buy. This fast paced movement of trends has created a term called fast-fashion, which is one of the major polluters within the fashion industries. There needs to be an alternative to buying clothes. 

## How will your project solve this problem?

    1. My projects promotes repairing salvageable clothing and promoting secondhand shopping at thrift shops or boutiques. This will help people get maximum use out of clothing and reduce waste.
